Integrated Genotype, Phenotype and Environment Acquisition, Monitoring and Association Tools for Adaptation
=====================================================================================

To keep pace and help stabilze a changing world, agriculture and ecosystem science
must aim to improve efficiency and regenerate natural environments of the biosphere.
Both fields must integrate the latest methodological advances to
accurately and rapidly find populations that perform optimally under a changing
climate. The TraitCapture project, lead by the Borevitz lab, aims to create an
end-to-en, integrated, plant genomics, phenomics and environment platform.

The SpectralPhenoClimatron provides reproducible advanced control of plant
growth conditions, capable of simulating regional climates and with integrated
high-throughput phenotyping. PlantScreen can provide high throughput measures of
advance, hyper-spectral phenotypes including measurements of photosynthesis and
temperature. Hierarchical genomic analyses from Genotyping-by-Sequencing to low
and high coverage whole-genome and epi-genome sequencing are provided within
TraitCapture. Computational image analysis provides quantitative, real-time
metrics of plant growth and behaviour on plants grown under dynamic
environments.  Statistical association of genotype, phenotype, and environment
enables QTL mapping, GWAS and related studies, including modelling environmental
interactions. Functional structural plant models allow analysis and prediction
of performance of genetic combinations under future or diverse climates.
Underlying all analyses is end-to-end integrated management of sample tracking
and data generation and analysis, allowing reproducible research and
open-source data.

The TraitCapture project is funded and many components have already been
implemented. TraitCapture is released under the GNU GPL, and contributions are
encouraged.
