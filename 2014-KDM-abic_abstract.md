To keep pace and help stabilze a changing world, agriculture and ecosystem science 
must aim to sustainability intensify and regenerate natural environments of the biosphere.
Both fields must integrate the latest methodological advances to facilitate rapid genetic adaptation
 under a variable and changing climate.
 
TraitCapture is a platform to integrate controlled environments, plant genomics and phenomics to do just this.
It includes the SpectralPhenoClimatron which provides dynamic control of plant
growth conditions, simulating regional seasonal climates and with integrated
high-throughput phenotyping. PlantScreen provides high throughput measures of
hyper-spectral, thermal, and fluorscence image based phenotypes including photosynthetic efficiency. Computational image analysis provides quantitative, real-time metrics of growth and development on plants grown under dynamic
environments. Hierarchical genomic analyses from Genotyping-by-Sequencing to low
and high coverage whole-genome and epi-genome sequencing are intagrated within
TraitCapture. Then genome wide association studies are used to disect phenotypic variation across environments into quantitative trait loci with candidate genes. Finally, functional structural plant models will be used to predict the performance of various genetic combinations under future variable climates to select what to plant where.
Underlying the experimental pipeline is end-to-end sample tracking and data management system that is open-source allowing reproducible research and data sharing.

The TraitCapture project is funded and many components have already been
implemented. TraitCapture is released under the GNU GPL, and contributions are
encouraged.
