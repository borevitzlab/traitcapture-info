Tools for Adaptation: integrating Environment, Genotype and Phenotype

=====================================================================================

To keep pace and help stabilze a changing world, agriculture and ecosystem science 
must aim to improve efficiency and regenerate natural environments of the biosphere.
Both fields must integrate the latest methodological advances to facilitate rapid genetic adaptation
 under a variable and changing climate.
 
TraitCapture is a platform to integrate controlled environments, plant genomics and phenomics to do just this.
The SpectralPhenoClimatron provides dynamic control of plant
growth conditions, simulating regional seasonal climates and with integrated
high-throughput phenotyping. PlantScreen provides high throughput measures of
hyper-spectral phenotypes including measurements of photosynthesis and
temperature. Computational image analysis provides quantitative, real-time
metrics of plant growth and behaviour on plants grown under dynamic
environments. Hierarchical genomic analyses from Genotyping-by-Sequencing to low
and high coverage whole-genome and epi-genome sequencing are intagrated within
TraitCapture. Statistical association of phenotypic variation with genotype and environment
enables genome wide association studies. Functional structural plant models will allow analysis and prediction
of performance of genetic combinations under future or diverse climates.
Underlying all analyses is end-to-end integrated management of sample tracking
and data generation and analysis, allowing reproducible research and
open-source data.

The TraitCapture project is funded and many components have already been
implemented. TraitCapture is released under the GNU GPL, and contributions are
encouraged.
