Tools for Adaptation: Integrating Environment, Genotype and Phenotype
=====================================================================

To keep pace and help stabilise a changing world, agriculture and ecosystem
science must aim to sustainably intensify and regenerate natural environments
of the biosphere. Both fields must integrate the latest methodological advances
to facilitate rapid genetic adaptation under a variable and changing climate.

TraitCapture is a platform to integrate controlled environments, plant genomics
and phenomics to do just this. It includes the SpectralPhenoClimatron which
provides dynamic control of plant growth conditions, simulating regional
seasonal climates and with integrated high-throughput phenotyping. PlantScreen
provides high throughput measures of hyper-spectral, thermal, and fluorescence
image based phenotypes including photosynthetic efficiency. Computational image
analysis provides quantitative, real-time metrics of growth and development on
plants grown under dynamic environments. Hierarchical genomic analyses from
reduced-representation to whole (epi)genome sequencing with haplotype based
imputation will be integrated within TraitCapture. Genome-wide association
studies are used to dissect phenotypic variation across environments into
quantitative trait loci with candidate genes. Finally, functional structural
plant models will be used to predict the performance of various genetic
combinations under future variable climates to select what to plant where.
Underlying the experimental pipeline is end-to-end sample tracking and data
management system, enabling reproducible research and data sharing.

The TraitCapture project is funded and many components have already been
implemented. All TraitCapture code is released under the GNU GPL, and
contributions are encouraged.
